# 🐧 Penguin Classifier App

An interactive machine learning web app that predicts the species of a penguin based on physical features like bill length, flipper length, and body mass.

Built using:
- Python 🐍
- Streamlit 🎈
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Penguin dataset (Palmer Archipelago)

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts species: Adelie, Gentoo, or Chinstrap
- Simple UI built with Streamlit
- Built-in model training with scikit-learn
- Easy dropdown inputs & sliders

## 🧠 Learning Goal
This app was inspired by [Data Professor’s](https://youtu.be/JwSS70SZdyM) YouTube tutorial series and helped me learn how to build, train, and deploy ML apps using Streamlit.

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/penguin-classifier-app.git
cd penguin-classifier-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
